    "Welcome to the Fu Lab Python Mini-course. In the next month, you will learn the basics of python in the context of using it for genetic analyses. This course is going to be presented in jupyter notebook - it is not necessary to also use the notebook, but it is a useful way of organizing code. \n",

    "### Expectations for the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the course is to create an environment for you to intensively work on developing your python programming skills and give you a crash course in the basics of the language. By the end of the course, you will not be an expert on python, but you should be able to write simple scripts and have the groundwork and general vocabulary to effectively use the internet and/or other resources to teach you fancier tricks. Most importantly, you should be able to ask yourself a question and start envisioning what ways you can write code that will help you arrive at an answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps a tiresome phrase for you by now, but it is very true: learning to code is like learning a new language. It takes lots of practice, and it continuously feels hard and unintuitive until suddenly, it starts sticking. Just keep trying and asking questions--it will just get easier and easier!\n",

    "## Basic Tools Required\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we touch any python, let's go over some of the main tools you will use as you write in python, as well as another language - Unix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is the the way you interact with your operating system. Most of you are used to the graphical user interface (GUI) you see when you turn on a computer - clicking the start button allows you to access a folder, which contains files that you double click to open within the relevant default application. However, there is a command line user interface (CLI) that is very useful as well. Both Linux and Mac operating systems use the CLI **Terminal**, in which we use the Unix language for navigation. In Windows operating system, this CLI is the **Command Prompt**, which uses a different language. If you have a Windows operating system, you should have already installed cygwin, a CLI that allows you to use UNIX in a Windows computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next vital piece in writing python code is a text editor. Your python code is usually written to a text file ending in \".py\", and then you can use the Unix commands to access and run the python script from your shell (Terminal). Sometimes, you may also want to use an interpreter, or a program that allows you to directly execute commands without calling on a script you save to file. Here, we will gain familiarity with the Terminal (or cygwin) shell and the Unix language, and use jupyter notebook to write our code to file and as an interpreter. Jupyter notebook can also be used as a shell, making it a powerful one stop shop for all the main tools you use to begin coding. \n",

    "## Navigating the UNIX shell\n",

    "We will begin by briefly exploring how to use Terminal (if you are using a Windows computer, then opening the Terminal means opening cygwin). Open the Terminal - you should see < username >@< whatever computer >. Type 'pwd'. From here, you get a file path indicating the set of folders leading to your current directory. That is, if you were navigating as you normally would on a your computer, you would have to click on each of these folders, from left to right, to end up in the folder the Terminal is waiting in (your 'working directory'). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **pwd**   = print working directory \n",
    "* **ls**    = list all files/folders in the directory\n",

For instance, if you were to write two filenames after 'cat', you would get both files printed to screen in order by filenames.\n",

    "\n",
    "A problem with looking at files through cat is that it is difficult to view large files printed to Terminal. 'head' and 'tail' allow you to look at the head or tail of the file, with a default of 10 lines. \n",

    "```bash\n",
    "head worldpythons.txt\n",
    "tail worldpythons.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes you might want to look at the whole file. Another command you can use is 'less', which opens the file within the Terminal, allowing you to look through the document one screen at a time. It opens from the top of the file, and you use arrow keys to scroll up and down. The space bar allows you to move a screen's worth of text, allowing faster scrolling. The default is word wrapping, but you can use '-S' to chop the long lines (thus you would need left and right arrow keys to view the long sentences). Typing /word will search for 'word' in the file and highlight wherever it appears. Type 'q' to exit.\n",

    "Above, we went through some of the basic functions of some UNIX commands. However, there are many sub-options for each of these commands that you may find useful. Here, we will illustrate a few commonly used ones and run through how to get more information on these options using 'man', a command that allows you to read the manual for the UNIX command in question.\n",

Since the filenames are printed to screen, we normally read the end of the printed string--thus, we reverse the order using '-r', printing from the oldest edited to the most recently edited. Lastly, the '-l' option also includes the file sizes, but they are just very large numbers. Adding '-h' makes this human-readable. Here, that means it switches these size output so that they are based on K (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes) and T (terabytes) for easy reading. \n",

All of the lectures, including this one, are provided in a notebook, so you will get many examples of its utility. While we do not explore all of the functions of the notebook, we highlight some of the basics here so you can navigate and write in these notebooks easily. \n",

Going to the top right and clicking \"New\" followed by \"Python 2\" under 'Notebook' will open your first jupyter notebook (ends in .ipynb) like the one we observe here. \n",

Other times you may want to interrupt the kernel, stopping whatever action is being undertaken.
